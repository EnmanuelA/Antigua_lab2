The objective of this assignment was to implement a calculator to
interpret strings of a specific form. The assignment is focused to
make me feel more comfortable with string operations, start using if
and if-else statements and also start using while loops to repeat
operations. This assignment is supposed to be a simplified version
of a problem I will be working on later on in the semester.

 The most important variables I used for this program are,
 "expr" = which is the main variable of the program, it will ask the
 user to input an expression so it can be evaluated.
"plus_sign, minus_sign, mult_sign, div_sign " = this are self
explanatory, they find the sign in the expression, could be a
plus sign, minus sign, multiplication sign, division sign, depending
of the sign, the program will have a different command.
"all_signs" = is basically whatever sign the expression has.

"num1Str" and "num2Str" take the first and second number and makes
sure we have numbers there, if not, its and invalid expression.
"num1" take the value of the first number and "num2", takes the
value of the second number.
"result" is the value of expression after num1 and num2 have been evaluated.

for this assignment I encountered a couple problems, one of the was
making the program know when the expression did not have number on either
side of the operator or when the operator sign was not plus, minus,
division or multiplication.

after trying different things, I stopped and though slowing and that
really helped me come up with the solution.
